# Reproducing "A Comprehensive Study of Real-World Bugs in Machine Learning Model Optimization"

## Project Description

This repository is an effort to reproduce and further explore the findings presented in the paper "A Comprehensive Study of Real-World Bugs in Machine Learning Model Optimization" by MOB2022. We were intrigued by the insights into real-world bugs affecting machine learning models and aimed to replicate their analysis, and potentially extend it with our own observations. This project serves as a hands-on approach to understanding the reproducibility of research in the field of machine learning.

## Paper Abstract (from original source)

*A Comprehensive Study of Real-World Bugs in Machine Learning Model Optimization*

(Insert abstract of the paper here. I will leave this as a placeholder for you to fill in the actual abstract from the paper once you have access to it. You can find the paper associated with the dataset at the original website or through academic search engines.)

## Reproduction

To reproduce the original study's analysis, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MOB2022/MOB-dataset.git
    cd MOB-dataset
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The original repository does not explicitly list `requirements.txt`. Based on the `.ipynb` files, you will likely need `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and potentially `tensorflow` or `pytorch` if you delve into the model-specific aspects. It's recommended to create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    # If you plan to work with TensorFlow or PyTorch related aspects:
    # pip install tensorflow
    # pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
    ```

3.  **Explore the data and notebooks:**
    The core of the analysis is within the Jupyter notebooks:
    *   `mob_plots.ipynb`: This notebook likely contains the code used to generate the plots and visualizations presented in the paper.
    *   `mob_study.ipynb`: This notebook probably walks through the methodology and analysis of the bugs.

    To open and run the notebooks:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open a browser window where you can navigate to and open the `.ipynb` files. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Findings

*(This section is for you to fill in after you have performed the reproduction and analysis. Here are some prompts to guide your writing: )*

*   **Summary of Reproduction Success:** Were you able to successfully run all the code and reproduce the figures/results presented in the paper? What challenges did you face, if any?
*   **Key Observations:** What were the most interesting or surprising findings from your re-analysis of the data?
*   **Insights Gained:** How did this reproduction effort deepen your understanding of real-world ML bugs or reproducible science in general?
*   **Discrepancies (if any):** Did you find any differences between your results and those reported in the paper? What might be the reasons for these discrepancies?
*   **Future Work/Extensions:** What further analyses or experiments could be done based on this dataset or paper? (e.g., applying different analysis techniques, exploring specific bug types in more detail, expanding the dataset).
